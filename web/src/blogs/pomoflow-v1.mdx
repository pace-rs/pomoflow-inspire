Well, here we are, valentines' day 2024. As with every year past, it's a time of relentless tropes and cliches, mostly existing for the sole purpose of making you feel bad and getting quick access to your wallet. Kind of reminds you of another set of trends we've seen the past few years, right? Productivity. You've read the title, don't act surprised.

For the past few years, we've seen any number of productivity tools, apps, systems, etc. Just type in "Organise your life in notion" into youtube and you'll be berated with a million and one ways to make yourself more miserable while at the same time wasting more time and doing even less. There might be a particular archetype of person that this approach is well suited for, but I'm pretty sure that's not most of us.

## Introducing Pomoflow

The entire purpose of pomoflow is to, instead of giving you a million things to do and a 52! ways to do them, to give you one. Just press the start button and get going. We're focused on simplicity and collaboration as a principle. Press the `Start collaborating` button to get a link to a pomo session that as many people as you'd like can join, really, it's that simple.

I don't really have much else to say here... enjoy the app!
